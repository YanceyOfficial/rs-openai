# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in RS-OpenAI, please report it by sending an email to [developer@yanceyleo.com](mailto:developer@yanceyleo.com).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make RS-OpenAI safe for everyone!
